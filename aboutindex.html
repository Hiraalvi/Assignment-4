                    There are lot of cryptocurrencies in the market with RIPPLE. Some of them are legitimate, some are
                    scams. However,
                    it would take time for the governments to understand the potential of cryptocurrencies. They would
                    have a much
                    harder time to distinguish the legitimate ones. Hence, it's hard to predict how the future of
                    cryptocurrency will
                    shape out .

                    Ripple can exchange it on the fly. Once you understand the applications of Ripple, you will
                    learn how to create a conditionally-held escrow using the Ripple API, and how to send and cash
                    checks.Finally, you will also understand the common misconceptions people have about Ripple and
                    discover the potential risks you must consider before making investment decisions

                    RIPPLE'S code is totally free and open source. The problem with open protocols is that they can be
                    froked easily.
                    Bitcoins protocol was froked mutiple times to create other currencies such as a bitcoin cash and
                    liteCoin.
                    People can easily frok ripple's code and build an advanced protocol that can complete with Ripple.
                    Hence,
                    partnership are the key to Ripple's future. They need more financial institutions using the XRP
                    ledger.

                    year. Currently, one XRP is valied at US$0.2902. One major difference between XRP and other
                    cryptocurrencies
                    such as Bitcoin is that you are not able to mine XRP in the way that you can mine other digital

                    crypto currency XRP. Rather, it's built on top of the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which is another
                    platform designed and built by Ripple as a protocol for connecting different ledger or payment
                    networks.
