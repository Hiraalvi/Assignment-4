                        Today, most of our transaction and interaction are done over the internet.
                        This not only includes the constantly increasing rise in the use of social media
                        for communicating. Most of us already use some sort of online banking system.
                        Even though banking transaction have been made easier and more convenient with the
                        introduction of online banking, there still are some hiccups that affect how we utilize the
                        system.
                        This where cryptocurrency comes in.

                    <h1 class="two"> XRP RIPPLE DIGITAL CURRENCY </h1>
                    <h5 class="three">
                        The digital currency, XRP, acts as a bridge currency to other currencies.
                        It does not discriminate between one fiat/cryptocurrency and another, and thus,
                        makes it easy for any currency to be exchanged for another. Each Currency on
                        the ecosystem has its own gateway e.g. CADBluzelle, BTCbitstamp, and USDsnapswap.
                        If David wanted bitcoins as payment for the services rendered to Lawrence,
                        Lawrence does not necessarily have to have bitcoins. He can send the payment to
                        his gateway in Canadian dollars (CAD), and David can receive bitcoins from his gateway.
                        One gateway is not needed to initiate a complete transaction, multiple gateways can be used,
                        forming a chain of trust rippling across the users.
                        <br><br>
                        Holding balances with a gateway exposes the user to counterparty risk which is also a risk that
                        is
                        apparent
                        in the
                        traditional banking system. If the gateway does not honor its IOU or liability, the user could
                        lose
                        the
                        value of his
                        money held at that gateway. Users that don’t trust a gateway, can, therefore, transact with a
                        trusted
                        gateway
                        that in turn deals with the 'untrusted' gateway. This way the IOU will be with the trusted or
                        creditworthy-certified
                        gateway. Counterparty risk does not apply to Bitcoins and most other altcoins since a user’s
                        bitcoin
                        is not
                        another user’s IOU or liability.

                        Ripple is a super-fast global network for payment processing where funds can get transferred in
                        less than four seconds. This is far than any other blockchain product such as Bitcoin (takes an
                        hour ) Ethereum (minutes), and the good SWIFT network (which takes days together).
                        Scalability
                        As per latest information on RIPPLE'S website, "XRP consistently handles 1,500 transactions per
                        second (TPS ).24[×]7, and scale to handle the same through put as visa" against the 15 TPS by
                        Ethereum or 3-6 TPS on the Bitcoin network.

                    One may wonder why RIPPLE labs, a small organization founded in 2012 and with just 150 employee s to
                    date , has takes the global payment industry by strom . Following are some of the advantages that
                    oir thousand-year old banking system never offered.
                   <li> Transfer of funds between domestic as well as cross-border banks is completed in real time in
                    under four seconds, in comparison to SWIFT gpi, which achieves the same in close to thirty minutes.</li>
                    <li>
                    Fees for transactions are nominal. The current minimum transaction cost as advised by the network
                    for a standard transaction is 0.00001 XRP (10 drops )in comparison to a whopping $25 for each wire
                    transfer over SWIFT.
                    </li>
                   <li>
                    RIPPLE eliminates the need for nostro and vostro accounts, which block a fortune to minimize the
                    risk related to the delay in liquidity when transferring funds from one account to another.
                    RIPPLE works with most of the flat and crypto currencies for money transfer.
                   </li>
                </h5>
                <br>
                <h5 class="three">
                    The XRP RIPPLES aims to solve the most pressing of these problems such as the high transaction
                    rates and the very long processing times that we have come to know.
